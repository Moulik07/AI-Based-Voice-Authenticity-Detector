# AI-Based Voice Authenticity Detector

This project leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence techniques to detect the authenticity of voice recordings. By combining the power of the Wav2Vec2 model with a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system can differentiate between real and synthesized voice recordings with high accuracy.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Feature Extraction**: Utilizes the Wav2Vec2 model, a cutting-edge AI model for audio processing, to extract intricate features from voice recordings.
- **Deep Learning Classifier**: Employs a custom CNN, a deep learning architecture known for its prowess in pattern recognition, to classify voice recordings as real or fake.
- **Twilio Integration**: (Optional) Can be integrated with Twilio to send AI-driven alerts or notifications based on voice authenticity.
- **End-to-End AI System**: From feature extraction to classification, the entire pipeline is AI-driven, ensuring robust and accurate results.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Transformers library
- Librosa
- Twilio (optional)
